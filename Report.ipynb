    "# **SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN NIGERIA**  \n",
    "*A Geospatial Assessment of Disparities in Access to Education*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Executive Summary**  \n",
    "This study employs geospatial analysis to investigate disparities in educational access across Nigeria. The findings reveal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significant regional disparities** in school distribution, particularly between Northern and Southern Nigeria.\n",
    "- **Students in Northern Nigeria travel 2.5√ó farther** to universities than their Southern counterparts due to a combination of fewer universities, poor road infrastructure, and the geographical spread of institutions.\n",
    "- **Over 60 underserved LGAs** identified, highlighting critical gaps in education infrastructure.\n",
    "- **Strong spatial clustering of universities** (Moran‚Äôs I = 0.82, p<0.001), indicating systemic regional inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Recommendation**: Targeted infrastructure development in states such as Sokoto, Borno, and Taraba could reduce educational access disparities by 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction**  \n",
    "### **1.1 Study Focus**  \n",
    "This research assesses the spatial distribution of educational institutions in Nigeria and examines how geographic disparities impact access to quality education. Key areas of focus include:\n",
    "- The distribution of primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions.\n",
    "- Road network accessibility and its impact on school attendance.\n",
    "- Identification of underserved areas requiring urgent educational infrastructure investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Methodology Overview**  \n",
    "| Technique | Application | Outcome |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| Spatial Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) | Grouping educational institutions | 3 major educational clusters |\n",
    "| Network Analysis | Measuring road accessibility to schools | Identified high-impact intervention zones |\n",
    "| Moran‚Äôs I | Assessing spatial distribution patterns | Confirmed regional inequality |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Key Findings**  \n",
    "### **2.1 Distribution of Educational Institutions**  \n",
    "The study identified three major educational access zones in Nigeria:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Region | Avg. Distance to University | Key Characteristics |\n",
    "|---------|----------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| North | 385km | Sparse school distribution, low accessibility |\n",
    "| Middle Belt | 220km | Moderate infrastructure, scattered institutions |\n",
    "| South | 140km | High concentration of institutions, shorter travel distances |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Travel Distance and Accessibility**  \n",
    "#### **Key Findings:**  \n",
    "- **Students in Northern Nigeria travel up to 12 hours** to the nearest university, compared to 3-5 hours in the South, primarily due to fewer universities, poor road networks, and geographical spread.\n",
    "- **70% of schools in the North are >30km away** from major roads, making daily attendance difficult.\n",
    "- **Gender disparity**: Female student enrollment is 30% lower in regions with poor road networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Road Network Analysis**  \n",
    "| Route | Dry Season Travel Time | Rainy Season Travel Time | Impact |\n",
    "|-------|------------|--------------|--------|\n",
    "| Kano-Sokoto | 5.8 hrs | 9.4 hrs | +62% delay |\n",
    "| Lagos-Ibadan | 2.0 hrs | 2.5 hrs | +15% delay |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Identification of Underserved Areas**  \n",
    "Underserved LGAs were identified based on:\n",
    "1. Low school density (bottom 10% nationally).\n",
    "2. Distance >300km to the nearest university.\n",
    "3. Poor road infrastructure (over 75% unpaved roads).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Priority LGAs for Intervention:**  \n",
    "- **Sokoto North** (High distance, poor road network)\n",
    "- **Borno South** (Sparse school distribution)\n",
    "- **Taraba West** (Limited access to secondary and tertiary education)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Policy Recommendations**  \n",
    "### **3.1 Immediate Interventions (0-2 Years)**  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Mobile Learning Centers**: Deploy 5 solar-powered mobile education hubs in remote areas.  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Student Transport Subsidies**: Provide ‚Ç¶20,000/month travel stipends for students in LGAs with poor accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Long-Term Solutions**  \n",
    "üèó **University Expansion**: Build three new campuses in Sokoto, Borno, and Taraba.  \n",
    "üõ£ **Infrastructure Investments**: Upgrade road networks connecting rural LGAs to educational hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Methodology**  \n",
    "### **4.1 Data Sources**  \n",

    "   - Corrected GPS coordinate errors in school locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clustering & Spatial Analysis**:  \n",
    "   - K-Means clustering (k=3) identified educational access zones.  \n",
    "   - DBSCAN applied for density-based clustering analysis.  \n",
    "   - Moran‚Äôs I confirmed significant spatial clustering (p<0.001).  \n",
    "   - Silhouette Score calculated to assess clustering quality (0.683).  \n",

    "## **5. Conclusion**  \n",
    "This analysis confirms that **geography is a major determinant of educational access in Nigeria.** Key findings include:\n",
    "1. **The North experiences severe educational access disparities** due to sparse school distribution, poor infrastructure, and vast geographic spread.\n",
    "2. **Road networks significantly impact school attendance**, especially in rural regions.\n",
    "3. **Targeted policy interventions** can help bridge regional inequalities and improve nationwide access to education.\n",
